**Authors: Cecil Barnett-Neefs, Martin Wiedmann and Renata Ivanek**

**Study: Examining patterns of persistent _Listeria_ contamination in packinghouses using Agent-Based Models**

_Note: large results data was zipped to be uploaded to this repo, each model's BehaviorSpace folder (i.e., Facility_A_Persistence/Analysis/Facility_A_Persistence/Data/BehaviorSpace and Facility_B_Persistence/Analysis/Facility_B_Persistence/Data/BehaviorSpace) contains .zip files that contain additional .csv files. These must be extracted to the BehaviorSpace folder (i.e., "Extract Here") for analysis in R_
